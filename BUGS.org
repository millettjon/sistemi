dropbox is not safe for keepassx db since they can be overwritten!
  - how can i check in to git?
  - solution
    - use git
    - create a wrapper that
      - warns if the dropbox version has been modified
      - opens the local git controlled copy
        - using a local copy avoids the "lock" file being synched w/ dropbox
        - merging has to be manual though
      - check for changes on exit and:
        - prompts for commit to git
        - copies changes to dropbox copy (checking for overwrite)
      - use unison?
        - can manage local roots
        - can detect changes and push/pull
        - can't store unlimited versions

talk to brian

more detailed development plan
  - create a milestone for getting the site up

social networking integration
  - tracking apis and reports
  - integrated publishing
  - organizing feedback

Home Page:
1. Make the BW images Color
   JM: check in dropbox for the color versions of images
2. Let's try without the grey box around everything.

Page 1:
1. The "Timeless" Image does not have the word Timeless appear next to it.
   - check if the labels are part of the image
   - don't worry about translating for now
2. The "Timeless" Image is still rasterized.
3. Let's use the space in column 3 under the red horizontal band to write "Site Currently in Construction".
   JM: remove the verticle gray bar
   JM: try and truncate the page smoothly?
   JM: fix browser incompatability issue to remove the infinite gray column1
4. Get rid of "My Account".
5. Get rid of "Trade and Contract Sales"
6. Replace "alpha version" with a system font.
7. Contact Us links to feedback page.
8. Review sign up for emails page

Our Vision:
1. Repair the page layout to match Page 1.

Online Boutique:
    SHELVES
1. Get rid of all the images and text in column 2.
2. Put the red horizontal bar across the bottom of the page just like Page 1.
3. Fit all the Functionality required on this page within the space freed up in column 2 and all of column 3.
4. Make sure that space is left in column two to allow for us to see without any hindrance the dropdown menu of Online Boutique when someone scrolls over it.
5. Fill out drop downs.

At Your Service:
1. When you submit a comment, does it actually go somewhere?
   JM: A) Server should send comments to email.
   JM: B) Integrate with support bee.
   JM: C) Is facebook/twitter/g+ integration useful?
2. Can a person have access to their comments so they can see what they have written in the past?
3. Color the words SistemiModerni red in the copy.
4. Fix the page layout to match Page 1.

The System:
1. Fix the page layout to match Page 1.

Gallery:
1. Let's nix the gallery for now.

Blog:
1. Let's nix the blog for now.
JM: Talk w/ copeland about how this relates to social networking sites.

Feedback:
1. Fix the page layout to match Page 1.
2. Take up real estate in column 2 if necessary to fit all the functionality.
3. Change the color of SistemiModerni to red wherever necessary.
4. End the last sentence of the first paragraph with a period after "quickly".

SUGGESTIONS - Maybe we should create the My Account page soon and give people the choice on that page to be connected to our own SistemiModerni social network of Architects and Designers.

JM: See if we can make a stack exchange site and how does that relate to support bee?

TODO: Feedback page should collect feedback and send somewhere.
        ? SupportBee?

These loads work when the autocad dlls are manually copied to the clojure-clr directory.
How to load assemblies in that are not in the current directory:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22012/loading-assemblies-and-its-dependencies
? Is there a .config file for ClojureCLR? No

? Does it work if the dlls from the autocad application are used? No
  ? Where are the autocad dlls located?
    ? In windows, how to you search for a file by name?
      Start -> Search

    dditional configuration information.  System.Reflection.RuntimeAssembly._nLoad (:0)
    - this was when autocad dll files where copied into the clojure-clr directory
      ? is the version wrong?
      ? what happens if LoadFrom is used?
        (System.Reflection.Assembly/LoadFrom "C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\Black In Xp\\Desktop\\ClojureCLR\\AcMgd.dll")
        Same error
? What happens if the objectarx dlls are copied over the top? Doesn't work.
  ? Where are the objectarx dlls?

  (System.Reflection.Assembly/Load "Acmgd, Version=18.2.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null")
  (Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices.Application/DocumentManager)

? Is it trying to access something that only exists in the running autocad app?
? Do all the dependencies have to be manually loaded?
  ? What if I load all the assemblies from objectarx?

? Is it useful to add assemblies to the GAC?
? Why does AdWindows.dll fail to load?
  ? Does a version of that come with clojure-clr? NO
  ? Is the autocad version different than the objectarx version? YES
? Does objectarx/inc-win32 have anything useful?
  ? What happens if the dlls from there are loaded?
? Add autocad dll directories to PATH?
  ? Does the PATH get searched for dlls?
? Add the autocad dll directories to the assembly folders registry key?
? Is the Clojure.dll.config file useful?

* General
Figure out how to transition code from copeland.
Figure out Copeland's role moving forward.
  - commitment level
  - work on SEO (page keywords)?
  - work on blog?
Itemize remaining work to have a functional website.
Think about commitment level.
Include the rest of Eric's translations.
Find someone to help with the spanish translations.
Page titles are inconsistent and overly wordy.
Features that are not yet implemented should be removed.
  (Make the site for actual customers not investors)
  - languages
  - cart
  - feedback page
  - discount codes
Copy needs revisited in general.

- 3 months

  - install site monitoring
  - which translations
  - get paypal working
  - get front end dev
  - seo: keywords
  - blog
  - equity
    - lisa: 3 points
    - copeland: 1 point w/ option to get more ownership


Them:
- fine with 3 days a week
- work 3 days a week 3500 every bi-week


- establish the 3-6-9 timeline
  - we might have our first pivot
    - eric, metal guy, creative, works in solidworks
      - cardboard box manufacturer next door
      - 5 min away from factory
- bold 30% transparent under construction
- splash page: images should be in color
  - they are on the dropbox
- search for a front end person to join the team
- make formula for fabrication costs
  - 4x4 shelving unit should be 400E base sold for 500E
  - need to figure out how much we can spend on paint
- autocad can calculate the area
  - use area to calculate cost

* Refactor
- remove all name.yml
- remove all code.clj
- all pages should use the standard layout where possible
- review and combine small files e.g., locale.middleware...

* Priority
** TODO create a diagram that depicts the registry data structures.
** TODO load path name translations from .clj instead of yml
** TODO move handlers from foo/code.clj to foo.clj
   - remove old handler loading code in sistemi.middleware
** ? should sistemi.translate be merged into sistemi.handler?
** ? how will name translation work if stored in .clj files?

localize
  - uses canonical path to traverse the namespace heirarchy
  - for each namespace, uses the locale to translate the current path segment
canonicalize
  -

foo.clj
  names
    :en "foo"
    :es "bar"
    :fr "baz

localize :es "foo"
--> "/es/bar"

canonicalize "/es/bar"
--> "foo"

site.clj
  :es
    "bar" "foo"
    "baz" "qux"

Note: canonicalization requires a bread first loading of namespaces

** move path translations from foo/name.yml to foo.clj
** change app.config to use .clj instead of yaml
  - remove yaml dependencies when done
** add test code to load all handers and check for path or string translation errors
** port to latest infrastructure
*** paypal pages
*** splash page
*** modern-shelving page
*** remove all code.clj files
*** remove all strings.yml files
*** remove all name.yml files
** remove the old string translation code, middleware, and yml files
** ? should www.url be www.uri instead?
** ? document some cases where java.net.URI has bugs?
** TODO Heroku is very slow
  ? Is it only the first time? NO
  ? How long does a simple ping request take?
  ? How slow is the dns query and why is it not cached?
    - up to 9 seconds; double cname indirection with many results returned
    - ttl appears to be 150 seconds for CNAME and 60 seconds for A
      - the local dns server does not appear to be caching correctly
    ? is the locale dns server a problem? possibly!
      - queries from linode server are fast (22ms) and caching works
  ? How fast does it run on linode?
    - run as a limited user
    - use firewall rule to forward port
    - allow repl?
    ? How fast is the ping from linode to heroku? 54ms
    ? How fast is the modern-shelving page from linode to heroku? 250-400ms
  ? How fast is it if I hardcode the ip?
  ? How fast is it if I use an open dns server?
** Get debugging working: http://georgejahad.com/clojure/swank-cdt.html

** DONE Rename sistemi.handlers sistemi.handler.

** DONE Update modern-shelving.htm and factor out common templating code.

** DONE Update the splash page to work with refactored string translations.
** DONE Save the request in a dynamic variable.
** DONE make string translations use the *req* dynamic variable
** DONE make string translation tables inheritable
** DONE store string translations in .clj files

** DONE Move configuration from yml to clj.
;; benefits of storing configuration in clojure instead of yaml
;; - simpler, code is data is code
;; - handler files use their actual name instead of code.clj
;; - 1 file per page instead of 3
;; - page testing is easier
;; - works with existing tools to monitor namespace changes
;; - can drop yaml support entirely
;; disadvantages
;; - bad config files can reek havoc
;;   - perhaps clojail can be used to alleviate
** DONE Menu links are not translated to other languages.

** DONE Changing locale fails on heroku.
  + fixed 3rd party referral detection
** DONE Heroku deployment crashes.
  + updated configuration merging to handle a nil staging configuration.
** DONE The modern-shelving page is loading the wrong template (vision.htm).
